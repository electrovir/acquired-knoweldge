### Setup GitHub Actions

My [catch-exit repo has an example](https://github.com/electrovir/catch-exit/blob/master/.github/workflows/tests.yml) of using GitHub Actions to run tests.

### Edit macOS terminal.app prompt

Enter the following into `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
export PS1="\[\e[32m\]\D{%F-%R} \[\e[34m\]\u@\h \[\e[32m\]\W\[\e[m\]\\$ "
```

* `\[\e[32m\]`: colors from [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit)
* `\D{%F-%R}`: date / time formatting from [here](https://ss64.com/osx/syntax-strftime.html)
* `\u@\h`: username @ host from [here](https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-prompt.html)

You can type just plain `PS1="<your-format-here>"` into the shell to test out a format without opening a new shell over and over.
